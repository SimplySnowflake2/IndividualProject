# MindScape Hub
Information on project:

This project will be application based, with various buttons on the home screen that you can press, which will take you to different pages. Some pages might include a clock, a drawing application, and a basic number generator of sorts (possibly prime numbers or the Fibonacci Sequence, etc). It will basically be a hub of a bunch of different random small appications all into one larger app.
