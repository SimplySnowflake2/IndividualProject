# MindScape Hub
Information on project:

This project will be application based, with various buttons on the home screen that you can press, which will take you to different pages. Some pages might include a clock, a drawing application, and a basic number generator of sorts (possibly prime numbers or the Fibonacci Sequence, etc). It will basically be a hub of a bunch of different random small appications all into one larger app.

## Project Objective
Features and Goals:

To make an app with a bunch or random little mini apps, in the hopes that the user will find at least one of them cool. This is so that I can have a larger audience for the app, when there are a few different apps for different audiences.
